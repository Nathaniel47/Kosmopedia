            Strive Masiyiwa was born in Zimbabwe, on 29 January 1961. When he
            was seven, his family left the country after Prime Minister Ian
            Smith's government declared a Unilateral Declaration of Independence
            from the United Kingdom.[6] The family settled in Kitwe, a city in
            north central Zambia known for its copper mines. It was here that he
            attended primary school, before completing his secondary education
            in Scotland. Masiyiwa's mother was an entrepreneur. By the time
            Masiyiwa was 12 years old, his parents could afford to provide him
            with a European education.
          </p>
          <p>
            They sent him to private school in Edinburgh, Scotland. When he
            graduated in 1978, he travelled back to Rhodesia, intending to join
            Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo's anti-government guerrilla
            forces.[6] However, he returned to education in Britain, and earned
            a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wales in
            1983. He worked briefly in the computer industry in Cambridge,
            England, but returned to Zimbabwe in 1984, hoping to aid the
            country's recovery following the end of the Rhodesian Bush War and
            universal franchise elections in 1980.[7]

            In 2011, The Times of London named him one of the 25 Leaders of
            Africa's Renaissance Award.[18]
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, Fortune Magazine named Masiyiwa one of the 50 most
            influential business leaders in the world,[19] and he was cited as
            one of the Top 100 most influential Africans by New African
            magazine.[20][21]
          </p>

          <p>
            In September 2014, the Chair of the African Union (AU), Nkosazana
            Dlamini-Zuma, asked Masiyiwa to help mobilise resources for Africa's
            response to the Ebola outbreak. This was the first time The AU had
            asked a business leader to undertake such a role.[22][23] Masiyiwa,
            with the help of other leaders, set up the first ever Pan-African
            fund-raising campaign known as #AfricaAgainstEbola Solidarity
            Fund.[24]
          </p>
          <p>
            The fund raised millions of US dollars from the public using SMS
            donations, with contributions coming from many African countries.
            The donations enabled The AU to deploy the largest known contingency
            of African healthcare workers to combat the spread of the deadly
            pandemic.[25]
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, Forbes Magazine named Masiyiwa in the 10 Most Powerful Men
            in Africa list for 2015,[26] and the International Rescue Committee
            (IRC) awarded Masiyiwa the Freedom Award.[27][28] The award is given
            annually to an individual who makes an extraordinary contribution
            towards supporting refugees and championing the causes of liberty,
            individual freedom, and dignity.[29]
